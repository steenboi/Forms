My experience with this GitHub assignment was very positive. The GitHub desktop program makes it very easy for users without much experience with Git to manage repositories without using a command line. Learning how to use GitHub will be very important as a future employee of the techonology industry, as many companies use this to collaborate on projects with other programmers and engineers. I plan on using GitHub for group and personal projects to generate more experience with this platform.
